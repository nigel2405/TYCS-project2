# TYCS-project2
This project is a peer-to-peer GPU sharing web platform that allows GPU owners to share idle GPU resources with users who need high-performance computing. Using a MERN-based system for authentication, session control, monitoring, and billing, users can remotely access GPUs for gaming, AI, machine learning, and rendering at low cost.
